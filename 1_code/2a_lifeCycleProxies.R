# The data are obtained from Compustat and CRSP, covering the
# period 1973 to 2014.

# financial (SIC 6000- 6999) and utility (SIC 4900-4949) industries are excluded
# from the sample because the former have relatively low physical capital
# investment, while the latter are under government regulation.

# a firm is included in the sample only if it has CRSP share codes 10 or 11 and
# is incorporated in US (FIC = USA)
# Share codes 10 and 11 refer to ordinary common shares with no special status or
# no special status necessary

# We require firms to provide valid information on their total assets, earnings
# before extraordinary items, retained earn- ings, sales growth, market
# capitalization, changes in cash holdings, investment, cash flow, and external
# finance. Some additional data exclusions are necessary: firms with market
# capitalization of equity less than USD 10 million or firms with abnormal
# assets or sales growth (greater than 1) are also excluded.10 To control for
# the effect of outliers, all variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th
# percentile. The final sample consists of more than 12,000 firms, producing
# over 100,000 firm-year observations.

# AGE is CRSP listed firm age
# RETA is the ratio of retained earnings to total assets
#
